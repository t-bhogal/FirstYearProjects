# FirstYearProjects
This repository contains three projects I completed in First Year. My results were as follows:
Full Stack Application - Romeo and Juliet - 86%
Full Stack Application - Fantasy Base Building - 91%
Object Oriented Programming - Semantic Embedding - 93%

I thoroughly enjoyed both of my programming based modules last year and believe these assignments exemplify the skills I learned along the way. I have attached a short description of each assignment task in the relevant folder, and have attached those same descriptions below:

**Romeo and Juliet**
•	Implemented TCP/IP client-server architecture using IntelliJ by creating methods in the Playwriter client class that requested ‘love’ values from the single-threaded Romeo and Juliet servers
•	Developed corresponding methods in the server classes that sent the correct values upon receiving these requests, until the threads were interrupted in the client class at the end of the play 

**Fantasy Base Building** 
•	Implemented data in a CSV file to build a database for a fantasy game, importing relevant data from the CSV file into PostgreSQL
•	Linked the data as directed using a mix of primary and foreign key constraints
•	Created a DO block that moved data from one table and to another, subject to a condition using additional data from the table

**Semantic Embedding** 
•	Used a Distributional Semantic Model file to identify words that are similar semantically
•	Manipulated the vectors in the DSM file using methods to determine the cosine similarity between a stated word and words in the file, using IntelliJ
•	Wrote a heap sort class to sort through the cosine similarity values to establish the top five closest words
